## 3. Business Basics
Business sells products or services.

#### Market
A market is all the people who might buy your product (or service) either from you or from a **competitor**. A market can be broken down into smaller groups of similar potential buyers, called **market segments**. 
Market segments might be set up by *geographic region, by age, gender, economic status, language, family status*, or many other descriptive groupings which will help you develop advertising and sales programs to reach these various groups of potential customers.

#### Customer Types
The most basic types of potential customers and customers are broken down into:
- Individuals: consumers or retail customers
- Businesses: companies, governments, schools, hospitals, and other organizations

#### Sales Method
There are three basic ways to sell your products or services:
1. **Direct Sales** – the customer buys your product or service from your company
2. **Distribution Channels** – the customer buys your product from another business, your company receives its money from selling to “middlemen.”
3. **Combination Methods** – Using both direct sales and distribution channels.



## 4. Starting Your Business

#### Personal Profile
Entrepreneurs should enter into business with the knowledge that it requires a significant **personal commitment**, which may impact strongly on their emotional and physical health, as well as on other friends and family members.
Knowing yourself, your strengths, weaknesses, expectations, and the demands of being an entrepreneur will help you to make the best decisions for your future.

#### Business Plan
The type of business that you would like to run should be based on your personality and interests, plus the opportunities you see for this type of enterprise.
A **Business Plan** can be a fancy printed booklet with pictures and glossy paper, or it can be a typed document.
A Business Plan should cover at least **a year** in detail. Some plans may extend out three to five years. You should be thinking in general terms of the future, but focus on what you can complete in a year.

##### Important because:
1. Planning Your Business Strategy
> You look at **who** would buy your products or services. 
> You calculate **how** **much** you think things will cost and how much money you will make. 
> You think of possible **alternative strategies** and how you might respond to competition. 
> And, you think of where your **initial success** might lead you in the future.
2. Seeking Loans, Investors, and Advisors
> A Business Plan is what banks will ask for when you need to borrow money.
3. Measuring Your Success: “How is it going?”

#### How to write a Business Plan?
1. Opportunity
> What is the opportunity that will allow your company to succeed? 
> Is there a lot of competition for your company? 
> Do you have superior products or services? 
> Do you have a totally new product or service? 
> Does your company have special experience or expertise? 
> Are your products going to be less expensive than the competition? 
> Is the demand for your product growing or shrinking?
2. Market
> What type of industry will you be in? 
> What is your target market? 
> You could break this down in various ways, for example, by age, gender, marital status, geography, or income. 
> Why will people buy your product? 
> What is the competition like? 
> What advantages would you have over the competition? 
> What disadvantages would you have?
3. Products and Services
> What are you going to sell? 
> How are you going to sell these products? 
> How do you plan to advertise your products?
4. Company
> Who is going to manage your company? 
> Who are your advisors: your lawyer and accountant for example? 
> Do you have a board of directors? 
> The quality of these people can be crucial for your success when starting a new business.
> You must also decide what legal structure you want for your business.
5. Financial Projections
> What types of sales do you expect?
>  What do you think your expenses will be like? 
>  How long do you think it will be before you start making a profit?
6. Executive Summary
> The Executive Summary should include a summary of all key information contained within the plan. 
> Care must be taken in writing this summary because in many cases, it is here that most readers will decide whether or not the plan may be of interest to them. 
> The Executive Summary should be kept as brief as possible – generally these range from **one to three pages** in length.

#### Business Name
Once you decide on a name for your business, you must conduct a search to be sure that the name is not already legally registered.
Consequently, you should always try to have **at least two or three** of your favorite choices ready.

#### Logo Design
A logo is a unique visual identifier that distinguishes your business.
Your logo should be used on all of your company communication materials, including letterhead, business cards, and on your storefront.
A logo normally includes text (the name of the business) and a graphic.
> **A good logo design:**
> - Imparts a single, strong message that identifies the business, and/or its products and services
> - Is a simple design, not an overly complex one.
> - Uses the appropriate colors.
> - Has a limited number of different colors — the fewer, the better.
> - Reproduces well in black and white, as well as in color.
> - Is scalable. It should look good on a large poster or on a small business card.

#### Seed Financing
- **Love Money**: Love Money is money invested in your business by yourself, friends, or relatives.
- **Windfall** (意外之财): Windfall is money that you receive unexpectedly. For example, winnings from a lottery, an inheritance, an insurance settlement, or maybe even a large bonus from your current employer
- **Bank Loans**: Bank Loans are commonly used to finance a business. Banks prefer to reduce the risk of their loans by placing liens on assets of the company and/or requiring the entrepreneur to sign personal guarantees for repayment, even if the business is incorporated.
- **Euity** (股权融资): Equity financing is also a very common type of financing, but it is almost always restricted to corporations, the most common type of legally structured businesses, because of taxation and legal issues.
With Equity financing, the entrepreneur receives money from an investor in return for part ownership in the business.
There are many types of equity financing arrangements, but the most common includes the issuance of common stock, or shares, and does not require any immediate repayment. It is important to note that whoever **owns more than 50%** of a company’s stock has complete control over that company. If you own less than 50%, you could even be fired!
Two key advantages are that repayment is not necessary and that additional people now have a financial interest in the success of your business.
The drawbacks are that you may be required to provide periodic reports to your investors, and some investors may even want to participate in daily decisions. And while investors may not require immediate repayment, they do expect to make a profit from their investment someday.



## 5. Markets and Schedule

#### Markets
- *Business Location*: You must strive to select a location that is most suitable for your business. When you operate a consumer-based business, you must have knowledge of the **characteristics** of the consumers who will frequent the location, be familiar with the **traffic patterns** of the area, and understand how this might all be affected by the **weather**.
- *Traffic Patterns*: Knowing **when** most customers will frequent your business, as well as when traffic will be light, helps you plan better.
- *Customer Characteristics*: Customers base their buying decisions on four factors: **Price**, **Quality**, **Brand Recognition**, and **Brand Loyalty**.
- *Weather*: Weather is another factor that needs to be considered when selecting a location because it will affect the traffic patterns of the location, as well as the consumer characteristics.

#### Business Schedule
Selecting the right business location must also be matched with the appropriate hours of operation for your markets.
To set your schedule, you need to understand the traffic patterns in your business location, and how they change in different times of day, days of week, weather conditions, and special events.



## 6. Products and Inventory

#### Products
Usually, a business makes its money by adding value to an item or a group of items in order to make them into a product.
The resulting product is more valuable than the items used to create it, consequently enabling such businesses to make their own profits.
Other businesses, such as retail sporting goods stores and clothing stores, do not create new products, but rather make existing products more easily available to the customer.
Service businesses, on the other hand, usually do not have tangible products. Instead, their services are their products.

#### Inventory
Inventory includes all the items (raw materials and components) that make up a product, or the product itself (finished goods).
In order to be able to make and sell a product, a business must have all inventory items in stock that are needed to make that product.

#### Pricing
There are two basic approaches for setting prices: **Cost Plus Pricing** and **Market Pricing**.
##### Cost Plus Pricing
Cost Plus Pricing means you add up all the costs to make and sell the product, and then you add an extra “plus” for profit to the company.
##### Market Pricing
With Market Pricing, you price your products according to what you think people are willing to pay.
Market Pricing is common in today’s selling environment. However, you need to make a profit on the products you sell. The price of your product should be higher than the cost of what you paid for the inventory items that you purchased to make the product.

#### Profits
In order for your business to survive, it must be profitable in the long run — in other words, it must make more money than it costs to operate.
Profits may come from different strategies. 
You might set *a low price with very little profit on each item, but make a lot of sales*, maximizing profits through the number of sales (companies like Wal-Mart do this). 
Or, you might set a price that will give you *higher profit on each sale, knowing you will lose a few customers* to your lower priced competitors (companies like Rolex Watch do this). Entrepreneurs have to make these strategic decisions for their businesses.



## 7. Hiring and Managing Employees

#### Hiring Employees
When you are ready to hire an employee, write an appropriate job description outlining the details of the job and the skills required to do it.
Once you review all of the resumes, highlight the most promising ones and contact those individuals to come meet you for an interview. Prepare a list of questions that will help you find the most suitable person for the job.
Once you decide on the best candidate for the job, you then make that person a job offer, outlining hours of work required, salary, benefits, and responsibilities.

#### Managing Employees
By maintaining a good level of **morale**, employees are more productive, efficient, loyal, better with customers, and so on.
Employee morale can be improved in a number of ways, from as simple as providing frequent praise for a job well done, to more tangible methods such as **salary increases**. **Bonuses** and **employee incentive programs** are also a common approach used to motivate and reward employees.



## 8. Attracting Customers and Advertising

#### Attracting Customers
The number of customers a business attracts depends strongly on the following factors:
- **Market and Business Location**: the location of a business may establish what the general types of customers who frequent this area, their buying habits, and their price/quality expectations
- **Weather**
- **Time-of-Day and Day-of-the-Week**: Careful planning is necessary to set the most optimized work hours for your business and its employees.
- **Product Price, Quality, and Attractiveness**: Your challenge is to sell the right quality products at the right price for your average customer in a given location.
- **Brand Recognition**: Brand Recognition is increased the longer a company is in business, and can also be increased by advertising. Advertising results are difficult to measure, so you must carefully budget how much money you spend on advertising and the type of advertising that works best for your business (TV, radio, newspaper, print, etc.)
- **Brand Loyalty**: Consistently satisfying customers by providing successful experiences is the key to improving Brand Loyalty.
- **Competition**: Customers have a choice and every business must demonstrate why it is **unique** in some way.
- **Advertising**: you are going to have to figure out how much money is worth spending on advertising and which types of advertising will be best for your business.
- **Advertising Plan**: First, Set Advertising Objectives. Second, Establish a Budget. Next, select the Message and the Media. Finally, make sure you set up an Evaluation Process to estimate the impact of your advertising against your objectives.
> There are a few things you should keep in mind when planning your advertising:
> ***Message*** 
> 1. A message must be received to be understood.
> 2. A message must be remembered to be acted upon.
> ***Costs and Value***
> you will have to make educated guesses about how much money to spend on advertising, without ever knowing the specific results. This is all part of managing business risk.

#### Different Types of Advertising
- Television: broad acceptance and a high believability factor, but expensive
- Radio: popular, but no visual aids
- Newspapers: distributed to regional subscribers, but only print
- Other Promotions: business cards, mail out flyers, posters, or make special labels, sales tags or restaurant menus.



## Business Reports

#### Accounting
Accounting is the system used to classify and interpret your business in units of money.
Maintaining these financial records is often called “keeping the company’s books,” or Bookkeeping.
Your accounting system cannot record what you think will happen in sales, only what does happen. So, *while financial reports are very important, they must be used in conjunction with other documents, like the Business Plan, to give a complete picture of your business.*

#### Financial Statements
Financial statements are designed to report the present earnings of the business (also called “profits” or “net income”) and the overall financial strength of the company.
The two most important financial statements are your **Income Statement** and **Balance Sheet**.

##### Income Statement
Revenues — Expenses = Net Income (or Loss)

##### Balance Sheet
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
>Asset: Something owned by the business which has future value (cash, inventory, equipment, etc.).
>Liability: A debt of the company with set repayment terms (payables, loans, mortgages, etc.).
>Equity: Investment into the business (which, unlike a loan, is not paid back) and the net profits (earnings) from operations that are retained in the company.

##### Relationship of Income Statement to Balance Sheet
The Income Statement covers the operations over *a period of time*, while the Balance Sheet is a snapshot of the company at *a point in time*.

#### Other Management Reports
> • Did you cover your costs for today’s sales? 
> • How happy are customers with your products and services? 
> • Which products are selling most? 
> • Are your revenues going up over time? 
> • Are expenses going up faster or slower than revenues? 
> • How many customers do you serve each day? 
> • What is your share of all sales on these products in the market?




## 10. Evaluating Success
> • Business profits. 
> • Employee morale. 
> • Customer satisfaction. 
> • Personal wealth generated. 
> • Time devoted to family, friends, and self. 
> • Personal stress level. 
> • Overall personal satisfaction as an entrepreneur.

#### Measurements of Business Success
- Profits
- Net Worth (资产净值): The cumulative value of the business is equal to its total investment and total net profits to date. This number is shown on the business’ Balance Sheet as Total Equity.
> The term Net Worth refers to the fact that Total Equity equals Total Assets (all that is of value and owned by the business) less Total Liabilities (company debts), or the net value (worth) after creditors have been paid.
> Caution: Both Profit and Net Worth are **historic measures**. They show only what has happened so far, and they do not indicate the true future potential.
- Market Share (市场份额)
- Time in Business: surviving and keeping a business running for a length of time
- Employee Morale
- Customer Satisfaction

#### Measurements of Personal Success
- Personal Net Worth
- Time with Friends and Family
- Stress Level
- Personal Goal Achievements
